Section 1: *“What is Project Management in the IT industry?”*

We’ll go step-by-step, as if you just joined your first IT company as a project management intern.

## 🧭 1. What Project Management Actually Is (in Simple Terms)

Project Management =
**Organizing work + guiding people + delivering results** — on time, within budget, and with the right quality.

In the **IT industry**, that means:

> Helping developers, designers, testers, and business stakeholders work together efficiently to build software.

Your main goal:
👉 **Deliver the right software, at the right time, in the right way.**

---

### 💡 Example:

Your company wants to build a **mobile banking app**.

Without project management:

* Designers don’t know what developers are coding.
* Deadlines slip.
* The app works on Android but crashes on iPhone.
* No one knows what’s done or what’s left.

With project management:

* Tasks are planned, tracked, and prioritized.
* Everyone knows the next steps.
* Progress is visible.
* Problems are handled early.

## ⚙️ 2. What IT Project Managers Do (Your Role as an Intern)

Here’s what a **Project Manager (PM)** or **Scrum Master** does daily:

| Area                  | What It Means                                     | Example                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**          | Breaking big goals into small tasks               | Turn “build login system” into stories like “create login UI”, “set up API”, etc. |
| **Organizing**        | Assigning the right people to the right tasks     | Make sure Dev A handles backend, Dev B handles frontend.                          |
| **Tracking Progress** | Checking what’s done, what’s pending              | Update Jira board, note blockers.                                                 |
| **Communication**     | Keeping everyone informed                         | Send updates to the team and stakeholders.                                        |
| **Risk Management**   | Spotting problems early                           | If testing is late, flag it before release day.                                   |
| **Delivery**          | Making sure the project is completed successfully | Plan releases, demos, and reviews.                                                |

## 🧩 3. What Makes IT Project Management Unique

IT projects are different from building a bridge or organizing an event.
Here’s why:

| Area              | IT Projects Are...                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complex**       | You deal with changing requirements, new technologies, and bugs.            |
| **Agile**         | Teams deliver in *iterations* (sprints) instead of waiting months.          |
| **Collaborative** | You work with many roles (developers, testers, designers, DevOps, clients). |
| **Data-driven**   | Progress is tracked using tools (Jira, Trello, New Relic, GitHub).          |
| **Evolving**      | Requirements can change mid-project — flexibility is key.                   |

## 👥 4. Common Roles in an IT Project

| Role                       | Responsibility                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Manager (PM)**   | Coordinates everything — deadlines, scope, communication.      |
| **Product Owner (PO)**     | Defines *what* should be built and *why*.                      |
| **Scrum Master**           | Facilitates Agile process — meetings, sprints, retrospectives. |
| **Developers**             | Write the code and build features.                             |
| **QA/Testers**             | Test the product to ensure it works correctly.                 |
| **UI/UX Designers**        | Design user interfaces and user experience.                    |
| **DevOps Engineers**       | Manage deployments, servers, and automation.                   |
| **Stakeholders / Clients** | Approve and give business requirements.                        |

As an intern, you’ll mostly shadow the **Project Manager or Scrum Master**.

## 🧱 5. Core Goals of a Project Manager

1. **Scope** — Understand *what* needs to be done.
2. **Time** — Ensure it’s done *on schedule*.
3. **Cost** — Keep within *budget*.
4. **Quality** — Deliver software that *works well*.
5. **Communication** — Keep *everyone aligned*.
6. **Risk Management** — *Predict and fix problems early.*

If these sound like too much — don’t worry.
You’ll learn them one by one through real examples.

## 📊 6. Example Scenario

Let’s take a mini example to visualize your role:

**Project:** “Add UPI payment in e-commerce app.”

| Step             | What Happens                                 | What You (PM Intern) Do                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Requirements | Business says “we need UPI payment support.” | Write down what exactly is needed — e.g., UPI, QR, PhonePe, etc. |
| 2️⃣ Planning     | Developers estimate effort — 2 sprints.      | Record tasks, confirm timeline.                                  |
| 3️⃣ Development  | Devs start coding.                           | Track progress in Jira, note blockers.                           |
| 4️⃣ Testing      | QA tests payments.                           | Make sure testing happens before release.                        |
| 5️⃣ Deployment   | Feature goes live.                           | Confirm no issues, send final update.                            |

You don’t code — you **connect the dots**.

## 🧠 7. Mindset You Need as a Project Manager

* **Be curious:** Ask *“why”* often.
* **Be organized:** Keep notes, deadlines, and action items clear.
* **Be proactive:** Spot issues early, not after they explode.
* **Be communicative:** Always keep your team informed.
* **Be empathetic:** Understand both technical and business people.
* **Be adaptable:** Plans always change — that’s normal.

## 🎯 Your Assignment (End of Step 1)

To lock this in, do this small task:

1. Create a simple note (paper, Notion, or Google Docs) titled
   **“What does a Project Manager do?”**
2. Write 5 bullet points in your own words — no copy-paste.
3. For each point, add one *example* (like “Track progress — e.g., update Jira board”).
