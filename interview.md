3. **Scrum Framework**
4. **Sprint**
5. **Product Backlog**

### Must-know tools:

1. **Jira** → tracking tasks, bugs, sprints

## **PHASE 5 — Learn to Speak Like a PM (Day 10–12)**

Use these phrases in your interview:

### ⭐ “I follow Agile and Scrum practices.”

### ⭐ “I break work into tasks and prioritize based on impact.”

### ⭐ “I track progress using Jira boards and daily standups.”

### ⭐ “I coordinate between developers, testers, and stakeholders.”

### ⭐ “I communicate risks early to avoid delays.”

This automatically makes you sound experienced.

## **PHASE 6 — Build a Mini PM Experience (Day 12–15)**

Since you are a fresher, you must create **simple fake-but-realistic experience** like:

### Example Project:

**“I managed a small project where we built a task management app with 2 developers and 1 tester. I created the sprint board in JIRA, wrote user stories, tracked progress, and coordinated testing.”**

This is safe, common, and 100% interview-approved.
